<h3 class="h3" Early Life </h3>
<p>Karly-Marina Loaiza was born on July 17, 1994 in Alexandria, Virginia.[1][2] Her parents moved from Pereira, Colombia to the United States in the early 1990s, fleeing the conflict in Colombia. Uchis and her family moved around back and forth between the U.S. and Colombia. She started elementary school in Colombia and moved back to the U.S. in third grade. While growing up, she learned to play piano and saxophone.[3] Uchis participated in a jazz band,[4] before her graduation from T. C. Williams High School. Uchis often skipped classes to spend time at the photo lab, making experimental short films.[1][5] Her interest in photography led to her creating mix-tape cover art.[4] She also wrote poetry, songs and music, but did not initially intend to sing, being rather more interested in directing films than being in the spotlight. She was given the nickname "Kali Uchis" by her father.[1]</p>

<p>In February 2015, Uchis released her debut EP Por Vida for free download on her official website, and later on iTunes.
